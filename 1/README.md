# ULL Practical 1: Evaluating Word Representations

### Reading the data


### Word similarity

The code in this section expects the word embeddings to be in memory. If that
is the case, the correlations can be obtained by running the cells in sequence.

### Analogies

The code in this sections also expects the word embeddings to be in memory. Again,
obtaining the results is straight forward. Just run the cells under the section
"Word Analogy". The second computes the MRR and accuracy (the sample size of the experiment has
been set to 100 for a managable execution time) and the third prints the
predictions for a hand picked subset of the analogies. 

### Clustering
